# Hermes Desktop parity refresh — 2026-08-07

## Scope and attribution

This is a bounded comparison of the shipped Hermes Desktop application with the
Hermes Android `dev` branch. It deliberately excludes Android/mobile issues,
proposals, and third-party clients. The report that prompted this work is most
likely GitHub issue [#2, “Connect Hermes Android to a secured Dashboard”](https://github.com/luinbytes/hermes-android/issues/2), which implements the
parent [#1, “Spec: authenticate Hermes Android through Dashboard sign-in”](https://github.com/luinbytes/hermes-android/issues/1).

Issue #2’s acceptance criteria are: collect dashboard URL/username/password;
sign in and persist only `hermes_session_at`; save only after authenticated HTTP
and WebSocket checks; expose reconnect-required failures without saving bad
state; keep credentials out of UI/backup/diagnostics/logs; prove the complete
connect-and-save flow against a fake dashboard; and pass focused and full tests.
Its parent spec explicitly makes OAuth and multi-account identity flows out of
scope. That is a valid narrow feature request, but it is not a 1:1 Desktop
parity specification.

The current upstream Desktop source was checked at Hermes Agent commit
[`f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/commit/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403), dated 2026-08-07. The Android
checkout was `dev` at [`f562904da792e1d5706d5dcede1cb9b6870a64ae`](https://github.com/luinbytes/hermes-android/commit/f562904da792e1d5706d5dcede1cb9b6870a64ae).
This auth path's oldest verified Hermes Agent version is `0.20.0`; Hermes Desktop remains `0.17.0` at that source pin.
The older [`desktop-parity-matrix.md`](./desktop-parity-matrix.md) is pinned to
upstream `5122ddd` (2026-07-17), so its “implemented” password-auth row is not
evidence against today’s Desktop contract.

## What Desktop actually ships

| Desktop behavior | Primary source |
| --- | --- |
| Remote settings probe `/api/status`, inspect advertised providers, and distinguish OAuth/password-capable gateways from static-token gateways. Password-capable gateways use the same sign-in button and downstream session path; Desktop does not expose a separate native password form in settings. | [`gateway-settings.tsx`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/src/app/settings/gateway-settings.tsx#L360-L371), [`gateway-settings.tsx`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/src/app/settings/gateway-settings.tsx#L523-L579), [`gateway-settings.tsx`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/src/app/settings/gateway-settings.tsx#L1282-L1337) |
| The OAuth login window uses a persistent Electron session partition. REST requests are sent with that partition’s cookies, and a WebSocket uses a single-use ticket minted by `POST /api/auth/ws-ticket`; the WS URL carries `?ticket=`, not a browser cookie. | [`main.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/main.ts#L5815-L5842), [`main.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/main.ts#L6009-L6162) |
| Current Desktop can select a native OAuth flow from the server’s `auth_flows` capability, opening the system browser and completing loopback + PKCE. The fallback is the embedded cookie login window. | [`native-oauth.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/native-oauth.ts#L22-L27), [`native-oauth.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/native-oauth.ts#L71-L129), [`native-oauth-login.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/native-oauth-login.ts#L69-L77) |
| The server contract that Desktop calls accepts `provider`, username, and password, sets access and refresh session cookies, and mints a short-lived single-use WS ticket. The status response advertises `auth_providers` and `auth_flows`; native PKCE is advertised for non-password providers. | [`routes.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/routes.py#L650-L739), [`routes.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/routes.py#L799-L828), [`web_server.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/hermes_cli/web_server.py#L3173-L3204) |

## Concrete parity deltas

| Priority | Shipped Android behavior | Desktop parity gap | Evidence / consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Login hard-codes `provider: "basic"` and parses only the first accepted access-cookie name; the credential store is one `DashboardSessionCookie`. | Desktop/server sessions include both access and refresh cookies and let the server refresh an expired access token transparently. | [`DashboardAuthClient.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/network/DashboardAuthClient.kt#L16-L80), [`SecureTokenStore.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/security/SecureTokenStore.kt#L20-L53). Current upstream’s password-login tests cover access-cookie expiry and refresh-cookie recovery: [`test_dashboard_auth_password_login.py`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/tests/hermes_cli/test_dashboard_auth_password_login.py#L234-L314). Android therefore falls to reconnect once its access cookie expires instead of matching Desktop’s durable session behavior. |
| P0 | Android validates status with the cookie, asks for a WS ticket, then opens `/api/ws?ticket=` without a Cookie header. | This is the correct current Desktop/server transport, but issue #2’s wording says the WS handshake itself must reuse the cookie. The report’s acceptance criterion is stale/misleading relative to shipped Desktop behavior; the red test must assert cookie on ticket mint and ticket-only WS upgrade. | [`DashboardBackendConnector.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/data/DashboardBackendConnector.kt#L26-L65), [`DashboardAuthClient.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/network/DashboardAuthClient.kt#L83-L110), [`OkHttpHermesGatewayClient.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/protocol/OkHttpHermesGatewayClient.kt#L48-L56), [`OkHttpHermesGatewayClient.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/protocol/OkHttpHermesGatewayClient.kt#L165-L171). Existing fake-dashboard assertions already encode this ticket seam: [`DashboardBackendConnectorTest.kt`](../../app/src/test/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/data/DashboardBackendConnectorTest.kt#L25-L43). |
| P1 | Android has no provider discovery and no capability-driven auth selection. | Desktop probes status and uses advertised password providers/auth flows; Android cannot connect to a deployment whose password provider is not named `basic`, nor choose native OAuth. | Desktop provider/capability handling: [`gateway-settings.tsx`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/src/app/settings/gateway-settings.tsx#L211-L371). Android hard-code: [`DashboardAuthClient.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/network/DashboardAuthClient.kt#L49-L60). |
| P1 | Android’s `AuthMode.OAUTH` is an enum value, but the shipped onboarding path only accepts `DASHBOARD_SESSION`; there is no Android native browser/loopback/PKCE implementation. | Current Desktop supports `native_pkce` where advertised and persists/refreshes bearer tokens for that flow. This is the largest user-visible Desktop auth feature absent from Android, although issue #1 explicitly marked OAuth out of scope. | Desktop flow: [`native-oauth.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/native-oauth.ts#L71-L129), [`native-oauth-login.ts`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/f15a38ee73631b3cd5f7d30765c37d5f0245d403/apps/desktop/electron/native-oauth-login.ts#L69-L77). Android gate: [`DashboardBackendConnector.kt`](../../app/src/main/java/com/nousresearch/hermes/data/DashboardBackendConnector.kt#L26-L32). |

The audit found two report-level corrections: retain the renewable cookie bundle while keeping the ticket-only WebSocket upgrade, and discover the advertised password provider instead of assuming `basic`. The `dev` implementation now includes both corrections. Native PKCE remains a separate parity ticket because issue #1 excludes OAuth.

## Development result on `dev`

The current `dev` implementation applies the report-related correction in this repository. Android now discovers the public provider catalogue instead of assuming `basic`, accepts a sole advertised password provider, retains the bounded access, rotating-refresh, and provider-routing cookie bundle, merges successful REST and WebSocket-ticket cookie rotations back into encrypted storage, and keeps the WebSocket upgrade ticket-only. The connector and shared REST seams have fake-Dashboard coverage for the complete login → refresh → ticket → WebSocket → save path.

This does not make the entire app 1:1 with every Desktop authentication mode. A native selector is still required when a Dashboard advertises multiple password providers, and Desktop's system-browser native-PKCE backend login remains separate work. Those are not part of issue #2's password connect-and-save acceptance criteria.

## Verification result

The `DashboardBackendConnector.loginValidateAndSave` fake-Dashboard seam now matches the current Desktop/server contract. It proves provider discovery, an expired access cookie with a valid refresh cookie, exact cookie-bundle reuse, access and refresh rotation, fresh ticket minting, and a ticket-only WebSocket upgrade. Negative coverage rejects invalid login, malformed cookies and tickets, failed REST and WebSocket validation, legacy token records, and expired saved sessions without persisting bad state.

The CI artifact for `dev` commit `015b0a1` passed unit tests, Android lint, debug APK/AAB builds, signing, and signature verification. A headless Android 16 Google Play emulator then completed the full onboarding flow against a bounded fake Dashboard. The server observed the expected provider and login fields, exact rotated cookies on REST and ticket requests, and no Cookie header on each WebSocket upgrade. Force-stop and relaunch restored the encrypted renewable session without another login. Resetting the fake server invalidated the saved session, and Android displayed the reconnect-required backend screen without crashing.

Native PKCE requires its own capability seam with state and PKCE challenge verification, loopback code exchange, token refresh, and token-authenticated REST and ticket calls. A multiple-password-provider implementation also needs a native provider selector. Issue #1 excludes both flows.
